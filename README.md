# 2d6

2d6 is my attempt at creating an alternative to roll20 for roleplaying games.

Currently, it has a simple chat system, dice roller as well as video and audio chat. 
The following are the next features to be implemented:

* Character sheets
* Campaign management
* Mobile character sheet variant
